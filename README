History:
-------------------------------------------------
Originally a simple downloader/extractor for scanning PHP
code, a build component was later added.

What it does:
-------------------------------------------------
- Finds and downloads each PHP release
- Extracts
- Builds
- Tests/compares PHP code

What it does not do, but will do:
-------------------------------------------------
- See the TODO

What is broken:
-------------------------------------------------
- See the FIXME comments that litter the code, and also the TODO

Requirements:
-------------------------------------------------
- PHP
- tar with gzip support
- allow_url_fopen enabled
- Allowance of readable and writable directories for download/extraction
- Note: initialize_environment() checks system for these requirements

Usage:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Edit configure options within inc/config.php
2. Execute run.php
3. Execute execute_php.php to test PHP code against each version

Notes:
-------------------------------------------------
- This all takes a good amount of time and space
